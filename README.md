# CourseDatabase
My unfinished work for my master thesis. But serves as a good start for a webpage with login and database.
The work was going to become a webpage for teachers and students to use at universities and high schools for planning courses. The signup for courses and distributions of students and teachers on the course is outside the scope of this page. It was solely intented to let teachers create course plans with the details for facilities needed and locations requirements.

Note that much of this work, probaly like a lot of other first programming projects, is copyed, borrowed and inspired by resources I have found elsewhere online and tweeked to my needs. THis means that I am not the original creator of the CSS and the other content is also borrowed and tweeked for learning purposes.
Have a look around.
The index in the root takes us to the front page, from where header is the actionable item. Here you can log in / out, create new user and hence create and administer courses.
All the info about users and courses are saved to a test database on MySQL.

None of the info in the database is sensitive. Ok, you may find my private email there, but no passwords or other peoples emails or contact info are stored in there. Most of the data is 'randomly' typed dummyinfo.
